# FinalProject

Hi! Our team name is Lailey! Our team members are Liza Dukhon (lid92@pitt.edu) and Haliey Lisak (hwl11@pitt.edu). We are group #2.
We used 3 datasets in our project:
1) Arrests https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f
   Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result    in an arrest. 
2) Police Incident Blotter (30 day) https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/1797ead8-8262-41cc-9099-cbc8a161924b
   The 30-Day Police Blotter contains the most recent initial crime incident data, updated on a nightly basis. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the    exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.
3) Non Traffic Citations https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/6b11e87d-1216-463d-bbd3-37460e539d86
   Non-traffic citations (NTCs, also known as "summary offenses") document low-level criminal offenses where a law enforcement officer or other authorized official issued a    citation in lieu of arrest.

Our goal was to find the most dangerous neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We collected data from these 3 data soures and filtered them to determine which city was the most dangerous AKA the best!
